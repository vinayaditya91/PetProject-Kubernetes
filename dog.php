									•	Bullmastiff puppies should be fed with adult dog food or large-breed puppy food in order to ensure slow and steady growth. Several small meals are best for puppies, and two meals daily is a good routine for adults, so dogs don’t have to digest too much food at each meal.<br>
•	Bullmastiffs require frequent grooming thus ensuring that shedding can be managed, and dogs should be bathed as needed. The skin and coat should be monitored in order to track the dryness or oiliness of the skin.<br>
•	Bullmastiffs usually excel in agility, obedience, rally, even scent work and tracking, so training should begin immediately and be a part of the lifelong bond between dog and owner.

									•	Great Dane should be fed with high-quality dog food appropriate to the dog’s age (puppy, adult, or senior). The primary killer of the breed is bloat (gastric dilatation-volvulus), where the stomach distends and twists, and multiple small meals per day and preventing vigorous exercise around mealtimes can help reduce the chances of it happening.<br>
•	Usually Great Dane’s short, smooth coat doesn’t shed much, but during the shedding season, hair loss would be profuse and daily combing would be a necessity. the dog’s usually long nails should be trimmed regularly.<br>
•	For a breed as large and powerful as the Great Dane, obedience training is a must. Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended.
